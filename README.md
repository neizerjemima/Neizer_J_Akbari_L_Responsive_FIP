TODO: Write a project description

We rebranded Zima Alcoholic Beverage, this was accomplished by designing and developing a refreshed identity for Zima. We created a three page website which are basically the Home, Contact and Shop page.  A new logo and product look was also designed to give Zima a refreshed look. An informercial was created and added on to the website amoung other videos to enagege our target audience.

## Installation
The web site was first drafted in Adobe xd to give a plan on how we wanted the website to come together. HTML, CSS and javascript was used in coding the website. The HTML was used to write the content of the page, CSS was used to layout the layout as well as give some response to the website and javascript was used to target the response and making the webpage engaging.
This website was made to perfectly to suite three different devices that is Desktop (1920 and 1200 ), Tablet (768) and Mobile (320).
